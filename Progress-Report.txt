What I've Completed So Far:
I’ve completed some of the base template for the app. I’ve also created a barebones structure for the Password Storage and Password Generator features.

Problems/Challenges:
I’m still figuring out how to implement user authentication for secure access.

Next Steps:
I plan to implement authentication at launch and improve the user interface to make it look more polished.
